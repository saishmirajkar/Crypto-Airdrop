## Introduction

Welcome to the ERC20 Airdrop project! This application enables seamless distribution of ERC20 tokens to multiple recipients. The smart contract is written in Solidity, and we use Hardhat as the development framework, Ethers for blockchain interaction, and JavaScript for testing.

## Technology Stack & Tools

- Solidity: For writing the smart contract.
- JavaScript: For testing the application.
- Ethers: For interacting with the blockchain.
- Hardhat: As the development framework.

## Requirements For Initial Setup

- NodeJS: Install NodeJS (any version below 16.5.0).
- Hardhat: Install Hardhat.

## Setting Up

1. Clone or download the repository.

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd erc20_airdrop
npm install
```

3. Run the airdrop test script:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

## How to Use

1. Perform the initial setup as described above.

2. Customize the smart contract to your specific ERC20 token and airdrop criteria.

3. Deploy the smart contract on the Ethereum network.

4. Execute the airdrop function, distributing tokens to the specified recipients.
